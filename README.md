Infrastructure Automation and Deployment Project
Overview
This repository contains infrastructure-as-code and automation scripts to provision, configure, and deploy an application using Terraform, Ansible, and Docker. It also includes CI/CD pipeline configuration to automate testing and deployment processes.

Repository Contents
File/Folder	Description
.github/workflows/cicd_pipeline.yml	GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD pipeline automation. Runs tests, builds Docker images, and deploys application.
app.py	Main application script or placeholder for application code.
dockerfile	Dockerfile to containerize the application.
docker.yml	Docker Compose file (if applicable) for managing multi-container Docker applications.
hosts.ini	Ansible inventory file listing target hosts for configuration management.
main.tf	Terraform configuration to provision cloud infrastructure resources.

Features
Infrastructure Provisioning: Using Terraform to create and manage cloud resources in a declarative manner.

Configuration Management: Using Ansible to automate software installation, configuration, and orchestration on provisioned infrastructure.

Containerization: Dockerfile to containerize the application, ensuring portability and consistency across environments.

CI/CD Automation: GitHub Actions pipeline automates build, test, and deployment workflows to accelerate delivery cycles.
